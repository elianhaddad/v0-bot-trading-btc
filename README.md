## 2. Machine Learning Basics

**Supervised Learning** (Used ✅):

- **Linear Regression** ✅: Predict asset prices based on historical data.
- **Logistic Regression** ✅: Classify price direction (up/down).
- **Decision Trees & Random Forests** ✅: Used for classification and feature selection.

**Unsupervised Learning** (Not used ❌ but useful to know):

- **K-Means Clustering** ❌: Used to group similar stocks based on behaviors.
- **PCA (Principal Component Analysis)** ❌: Data dimensionality reduction.

**Project Task**:

- ✅ Implement basic strategies like **moving average crossover** or **trend following**.
- ✅ Build a classification model to predict price movements.

## 3. Time Series Analysis & Feature Engineering

**Time Series Analysis** (Used ✅):

- **AR & ARIMA Models** ✅: Predict prices based on past data.
- **Seasonality & Trends** ✅: Identify patterns in financial data.

**Feature Engineering** (Used ✅):

- ✅ Technical Indicators: Use SMA, EMA, RSI, MACD for the bot’s decision-making.

**Project Task**:

- ✅ Implement technical indicator-based features and feed them into models.
- ✅ Train models using the past 60 days of stock data.

## 4. Deep Learning & Reinforcement Learning

**Deep Learning** (Not used ❌ but useful to know):

- **LSTMs & Transformers** ❌: Used for complex time-series forecasting.
- **CNNs & GANs** ❌: Image and generative-based analysis, not relevant to trading.

**Reinforcement Learning** (Used ✅):

- ✅ **Q-Learning**: Build an agent that makes buy/sell/hold decisions.
- ✅ **Deep Q-Networks (DQN)**: Handle complex market states with neural networks.

**Project Task**:

- ✅ Implement a Q-learning agent for autonomous trading.
- ✅ Use DQN to optimize decision-making in live trading.

---

## 5. Arbitrage Strategy

**Arbitrage Trading** (Used ✅):

- ✅ Spot price discrepancies across exchanges (crypto/stock markets).
- ✅ **Triangular Arbitrage**: Find pricing mismatches between three currencies.

**Project Task**:

- ✅ Implement an arbitrage strategy by monitoring price differences between exchanges.
- ✅ Automate buying/selling across platforms.

---

## 6. Backtesting & Evaluation

**Backtesting Frameworks** (Used ✅):

- ✅ `Backtrader` or `Zipline`: Test strategies on historical data.
- ✅ Implement risk management: Stop-loss, take-profit, position sizing.

**Evaluation Metrics** (Used ✅):

- ✅ **Sharpe Ratio**: Assess risk-adjusted returns.
- ✅ **Drawdown**: Measure peak-to-trough declines.

**Project Task**:

- ✅ Backtest strategies on historical data.
- ✅ Optimize strategy performance based on metrics.

---

## 7. Real-Time Trading & Deployment

**Real-Time Data Integration** (Used ✅):

- ✅ Use APIs from **Alpaca**, **Binance**, or **Coinbase Pro**.

**Deployment** (Used ✅):

- ✅ Deploy bot to **AWS**, **Google Cloud**, or **Azure**.
- ✅ Implement monitoring tools for real-time performance.

**Project Task**:

- ✅ Set up bot to trade live (start with small capital).
- ✅ Monitor real-time performance and adjust strategies accordingly.

---

## 8. Continuous Improvement (Ongoing Learning)

**Advanced AI & Finance Topics** (Not used ❌ but good to explore later):

- **Bayesian Methods** ❌: Probabilistic modeling for financial decisions.
- **Ensemble Methods** ❌: Boosting/bagging strategies for better model predictions.
- **MLOps** ❌: Automate model deployment and monitoring in production.
